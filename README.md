# minimal setup to test it

minimal setup

```shell
bun install
```

build the project and copy the bin to  ~/bin/ (remember to have ~/bin in the $PATH)

```
bun run build
bun run cp
```


then use this .sketchybarrc to test

```shell
#!/bin/bash

FIFO=/tmp/wentsketchy

"$HOME/bin/wentsketchy" start --fifo=$FIFO
```

and this in .aerospace.toml to test

```shell
exec-on-workspace-change = [
  '/bin/bash',
  '-c',
  'echo "aerospace_workspace_change { \"focused\": \"$AEROSPACE_FOCUSED_WORKSPACE\", \"prev\": \"$AEROSPACE_PREV_WORKSPACE\" } Â¬" > /tmp/wentsketchy',
]
```

## architecture

how it works?

wentsketchy is a simple go application to run by cli
it uses a fifo (named pipe) to handle communications between aerospace and sketchybar
it caches some aerospace data to keep it fast, and renews it every minute
sketchybar items will emit `update + sketchybar args`
aerospace items will emit specific events, such as `aerospace-workspace-change + sketchybar args`


## TODO
- get aerospace mode (layout, tabbed, etc)
- get aerospace fullscreen
- wifi item
- cpu & fan item

# # Known limitations

- order of windows 
 there's no way to have a correct order of windows from aerospace
- highlight single window
  we have a front-app event from sketchybar, but no front-window events from anyone
  we can get the focused window, but no event to react to
